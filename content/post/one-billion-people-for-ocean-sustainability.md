I am the organiser of [TEDxCowes](https://TEDxCowes.com) «Ocean : Inspire» which focused on Ocean Sustainability and gathered over 80k views after publishing the [talks on YouTube TEDx channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDKyxw8w2Vn2sFiUIdEJeLJnUqsnG-zMi) 2 weeks ago. 

«Ocean : Inspire» is part of my mission to inspire #OneBillion people to take individual and collective action for Ocean Sustainability. 

I mobilise people and organisations to inspire multiplicative action for Ocean Sustainability with Events, Talks, Documentaries.
